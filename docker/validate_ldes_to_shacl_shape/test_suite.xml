		This is the test suite's entry point file as it points to the test cases which in turn point to other scriptlets and resources. In general there is
		no requirement on the structure of a test suite but it is a good practice to keep things organised with a consistent structure that makes sense to you
		(e.g. a "test_cases" folder for the test cases, a "scriptlets" folder for scriptlets, "resources" for files to import etc.).
